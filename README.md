and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your personal information when You
use the Application or the Website and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law

Subscriptions
Subscription period
The Service or some parts of the Service are available only with a paid Subscription. You will be
billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (such as daily, weekly, monthly or annually),
depending on the type of Subscription plan you select when purchasing the Subscription.
At the end of each period, Your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same
conditions unless You cancel it or the developer cancels it.
Subscription cancellations
You may cancel Your Subscription renewal either through Your Account settings page or by
contacting the developer. You will not receive a refund for the fees You already paid for Your
current Subscription period and You will be able to access the Service until the end of Your
current Subscription period.
If the Subscription has been made through an In-app Purchase, You can cancel the renewal of
Your Subscription with the Application Store.
Billing
You shall provide the developer with accurate and complete billing information including full
name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information.
Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, the developer will issue an electronic
invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full
payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
If the Subscription has been made through an In-app Purchase, all billing is handled by the
Application Store and is governed by the Application Store's own terms and conditions.
Fee Changes
The developer, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees. Any
Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period.
The developer will provide You with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees
to give You an opportunity to terminate Your Subscription before such change becomes
effective.
Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect
constitutes Your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
Refunds
Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.
Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by the developer on a
case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of the developer.
If the Subscription has been made through an In-app purchase, the Application Store's refund
policy will apply. If You wish to request a refund, You may do so by contacting the Application
Store directly.
In-app Purchases
The Application may include In-app Purchases that allow you to buy products, services or
Subscriptions.
More information about how you may be able to manage In-app Purchases using your Device
may be set out in the Application Store's own terms and conditions or in your Device's Help
settings.
In-app Purchases can only be consumed within the Application. If you make a In-app Purchase,
that In-app Purchase cannot be cancelled after you have initiated its download. In-app
Purchases cannot be redeemed for cash or other consideration or otherwise transferred.
If any In-app Purchase is not successfully downloaded or does not work once it has been
successfully downloaded, we will, after becoming aware of the fault or being notified to the fault
by You, investigate the reason for the fault. We will act reasonably in deciding whether to
provide You with a replacement In-app Purchase or issue You with a patch to repair the fault. In
no event will We charge You to replace or repair the In-app Purchase. In the unlikely event that
we are unable to replace or repair the relevant In-app Purchase or are unable to do so within a
reasonable period of time and without significant inconvenience to You, We will authorize the
Application Store to refund You an amount up to the cost of the relevant In-app Purchase.
Alternatively, if You wish to request a refund, You may do so by contacting the Application Store
directly.
You acknowledge and agree that all billing and transaction processes are handled by the
Application Store from where you downloaded the Application and are governed by that
Application Store's own terms and conditions.
If you have any payment related issues with In-app Purchases, then you need to contact the
Application Store directly.
Intellectual Property
The Service and its original content (excluding Content provided by You or other users),
features and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of the developer and its
licensors.
The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the Country and
foreign countries.
Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service
without the prior written consent of the developer.
Your Feedback to Us
You assign all rights, title and interest in any Feedback You provide the developer. If for any
reason such assignment is ineffective, You agree to grant the developer a non-exclusive,
perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free, worldwide right and license to use, reproduce, disclose,
sub-license, distribute, modify and exploit such Feedback without restriction.
Links to Other Websites
Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or
controlled by the developer.
The developer has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy
policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and
agree that the developer shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage
or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any
such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.
We strongly advise You to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party
web sites or services that You visit.
Limitation of Liability
Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the developer and any
of its suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the
foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if
You haven't purchased anything through the Service.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the developer or its
suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever
(including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for
business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to
the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used
with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the
developer or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the
remedy fails of its essential purpose.
Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental
or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In
these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer
The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects
without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the
developer, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors
and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or
otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness
for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course
of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing,
the developer provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind
that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or
work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption,
meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or
will be corrected.
Without limiting the foregoing, neither the developer nor any of the developer’s provider makes
any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or
availability of the Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included
thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability,
or currency of any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service,
its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the developer are free of viruses,
scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on
applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations
may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section
shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.
Governing Law
The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Terms and Your
use of the Service. Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local, state,
national, or international laws.
Disputes Resolution
If You have any concern or dispute about the Service, You agree to first try to resolve the
dispute informally by contacting the developer.
For European Union (EU) Users
If You are a European Union consumer, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the
law of the country in which You are resident.
United States Federal Government End Use Provisions
If You are a U.S. federal government end user, our Service is a "Commercial Item" as that term
is defined at 48 C.F.R. §2.101.
United States Legal Compliance
You represent and warrant that (i) You are not located in a country that is subject to the United
States government embargo, or that has been designated by the United States government as
a "terrorist supporting" country, and (ii) You are not listed on any United States government list
of prohibited or restricted parties.
Severability and Waiver
Severability
If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be
changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent
possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
Waiver
Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an
obligation under these Terms shall not affect a party's ability to exercise such right or require
such performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of
any subsequent breach.
Translation Interpretation
These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if We have made them available to You
on our Service. You agree that the original English text shall prevail in the case of a dispute.
Changes to These Terms and Conditions
We reserve the right, at Our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a
revision is material We will make reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to
any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at Our sole
discretion.
